# Deconst developer.rackspace.com Jekyll Content

This repository contains the Jekyll site content from the existing [developer.rackspace.com](https://github.com/rackerlabs/developer.rackspace.com) repository. I've forked it temporarily so that I can customize it with my own Travis build and webhooks to integrate it into a Deconst preview.
